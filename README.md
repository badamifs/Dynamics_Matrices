# Network Dynamics Measures for EEG
_Code accompanying Rosch et al (2017): Network dynamics in the healthy and epileptic developing brain_

This repository contains code that can be used to reproduce analyses to identify differences in network dynamics between different resting state EEG patterns. This code was used for the above manuscript to describe abnormalities in network dynamics that characterise two severe epilepsy syndromes of early infancy, Ohtahara syndrome and West syndrome / Infantile Spasms.
